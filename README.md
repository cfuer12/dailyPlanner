# dailyPlanner
Created a daily use planner for a user to add events to their day.

I needed to create a Daily Scheduler so a person can plan and personalize their daily plans on some type of web app. With it being created, a person can keep track of what they need to do for the day. 

Started off by creating a JS page as we were not provided with the code to start, we were only provided the CSS and the HTML with all the added links to use jQuery funtions and Moment.js. 

On the JS page, I made and commented on the code I worked with for the assignment. I added a function that would display current date and time up top by using moment.js. Then i started by making the page layout, creating rows from 9am to 5pm, with the added time slot feature and added save button to the end. Inside of the row, the user would be able to type out what he would do for the day in that text box, and then would be able to save it to a local storage afterwards in which if the user were to close the page, they would be able to go back to the saved items on the re-opened web page. 

I also needed to add a display to which the user can tell if the curent planned item is listed as a past, present or future item. This would be displayed by having the box highlight the color 'gray' for past, 'green' for future and 'red; for present. I couldnt get this portion to function properly, as requested per the example.
